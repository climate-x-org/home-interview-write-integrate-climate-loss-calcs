    # so all of its value would be lost. This has to be adjusted by the probability of it happening
    # though, because it may or may not happen.

    # Because we know that every year, each building will require some maintenance, for which 
    # we know the cost.

    # is the fact that is a building collapses, its maintenance costs will become 0 for all 
    # of the following years.
